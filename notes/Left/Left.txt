Things to work on next!

Walls
-- Fix height/layering issue
   -- Look into using depth?
      -- can you use depth on each individual layer? 
	     aka, can walls always be higher then squares, 
	    -- "y" is depth, since we want walls lower vertically 
	       to be on top of the other ones (a little counter intuitive)
	  
-- Fix square alignment
  -- Not sure how to handle having the line between squares
	 Because that's how the wall sprite was created (to fit on the line between the two squares
	 Probably need to adjust the wall sprite then
