Things to work on next!

WHERE I HAVE LEFT OFF:
- Player movement
- Need to update collision mask for wall sprite
  - Split up wall into two objects 

Walls
-- Fix wall sprite 
  -- Remove secondary color, go all black
  -- Make it align with the square
	  
-- Fix square alignment?
  -- Not sure how to handle having the line between squares
	 Because that's how the wall sprite was created (to fit on the line between the two squares
	 Probably need to adjust the wall sprite then
	 
Grid
-- Look into creating normal grid rows/columns instead of diagonal ones?
-- Plan B: Make converting tool

Camera
-- Set up camera/viewport/room_size programtically rather than in the room editor
