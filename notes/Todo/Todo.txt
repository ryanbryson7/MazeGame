Things to work on next!

Walls
-- Fix wall sprite 
  -- Remove secondary color, go all black
  -- Make it align with the square
	 
Grid (might not do this)
-- Look into creating normal grid rows/columns instead of diagonal ones?
-- Plan B: Make converting tool

Camera
-- Make the camera/viewport not stretch things
-- Add player tracking
-- Zoom in camera
